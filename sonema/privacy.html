      <p>
        Sonema works by firing requests to servers (most often those of Rate
        Your Music (RYM) (https://*.rateyourmusic.com/*)) from your device in
        response to actions. Following each request, additional requests may be
        sent to render cosmetic features of a page (ex. to *.snmc.io/* to get
        images), as specified by the response. As a result,
        <strong
          >usage of Sonema is primarily governed by
          <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/privacy"
            >RYM‚Äôs privacy policy</a
          ></strong
        >, and the privacy policies of other services you may opt into using.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, in the exclusive cases described below, an additional
        request may be fired to my servers (enterprise.evan.rest/*) for various
        reasons relating to the improvement of the Sonema app (ex. analytics).
        Specific data, to the best of my ability and to the extent of
        Cloudflare‚Äôs privacy policy and terms of service, will only be shared to
        me, however in certain cases may be made available in aggregate (for
        example, to RYM).

            servers containing some analytical data. It will not include your

          click <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/account/signup">here</a> to

          Sometimes, after encountering a bug,
          <strong
            >you will be asked for permission to report this issue to me</strong
          >. This report may contain the serialized navigation path to the view
          the bug occurred on, your RYM username (IF preferences &gt; advanced
          &gt; ‚Äúallow me to follow up on feedback‚Äù is enabled (default: enabled)
          AND you are logged in), and the textual description of the bug (which
          will also be presented to you). If permission to report the bug is
          granted, that permission is valid until the report is successfully
          performed, and the you will continue to be prompted for all subsequent
          bug reports.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes, <strong>Sonema may ask you for feedback</strong>. When you
          provide feedback, the full contents of the feedback and your RYM
          username (IF preferences &gt; advanced &gt; ‚Äúallow me to follow up on
          feedback‚Äù is enabled (default: enabled) AND you are logged in) will be
          sent to my server.
